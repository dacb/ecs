There's some common elements here in the package development world. `core.py` contains, well, the core code of the package. In a larger package you might have other modules living here such as `analysis.py` or `visualize.py`, depending on how you want to organize your code. For now, the `core.py` file contains four functions: `load_data, data_setup, baseline_model` and one class: `Benchmark`. You can learn more about pythonic naming conventions from the [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) documentation.\n",

This is because github allows us to directly host our statically generated files with Sphinx. As your code grows up, you'll want to migrate to something more robust like readthedocs.io. The downside of doing this initially is that readthedocs compiles your website as you push to github and little changes in your code structure or prerequisites can break the build. It's just easier to put this work off until you're at version 0.0.1.\n",
